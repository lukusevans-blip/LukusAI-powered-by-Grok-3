# LukusAI: A Modular Multi-Agent Cognitive Architecture  
### Version 1.0

## 1. Introduction
LukusAI is a hybrid modular reasoning system combining human-designed architecture with multi-model AI processing (ChatGPT 5.1 + Grok 3). The goal is a stable, auditable, multi-agent system capable of reasoning, filtering, and orchestrating tasks with controlled drift.

---

## 2. Design Philosophy
- **Human/Audit First** – AI outputs never overwrite truth.
- **Modularity** – Cognitive functions split into independent “ThinkerBots.”
- **Lineage Integrity** – Timestamps, branches, and snapshots preserve origin.
- **Multi-AI Synergy** – Both Grok 3 & ChatGPT extend capability without breaking structure.

---

## 3. Core Architecture Overview
1. **Wingman Core** – orchestrates tasks, routes information, calls bots.
2. **ThinkerBots** – Cognitive helpers:
   - RiskBot  
   - LogicBot  
   - CreativityBot  
   - KnowledgeBot  
3. **Meta Layer** – Filter + Resolve conflict handler.
4. **Snapshot System** – Memory & state preservation.
5. **Audit System** – Tracks outputs, versions, branches.

---

## 4. Wingman Core Specification
- Primary orchestrator.
- Decides which ThinkerBot to call.
- Interprets user intent (“Lukus Cane Evans #0047” required).
- Maintains logical flow.
- Delegates to Snapshot System.

Workflow JSON lives in `/core/Wingman_Core/workflow.json`.

---

## 5. ThinkerBots — Detailed Specs

### RiskBot
- Assesses decisions.
- Assigns risk tiers.
- Prevents unsafe system drift.

### LogicBot
- Performs step-by-step reasoning.
- Validates structure & facts.

### CreativityBot
- Ideation.
- Generative rewriting.
- Concept expansion.

### KnowledgeBot
Defined by 3 files:
- **what.json** – domain knowledge  
- **how.json** – methods  
- **when.json** – trigger rules  

---

## 6. Meta Layer (Filter + Resolve)
- Filters invalid, conflicting, or drifting outputs.
- Resolves multibot inputs into unified answer.
- Prevents runaway AI behavior.
- Logic ensures **consistency over time**.

---

## 7. Snapshot & Memory System
Snapshots store:
- System state
- Active tasks
- Branch references
- Changelogs

Snapshots are versioned by timestamp registry.

---

## 8. Audit & Lineage Protocol
- All files commit into `/audits/`
- No deletion allowed.
- Every AI-generated file logged with:
  - Model
  - Timestamp
  - Prompt hash
  - Output hash

Ensures legal traceability.

---

## 9. GitHub Branching Model
Branches represent:
- human-stable code
- Grok 3 drafts
- ChatGPT drafts
- experimental modules

The Branch Map defines lineage.

---

## 10. AI Collaboration Model
**ChatGPT 5.1** = structured logic + refinement  
**Grok 3** = raw exploration + long-context + divergent drafts  

Both feed into Wingman for integration.

---

## 11. Safety & Drift Control
- Meta Layer enforces consistency
- Naming + timestamps prevent mutation
- Multi-AI isolation prevents contamination
- Human verification required for stable commits

---

## 12. Author Proof
This system was designed, named, structured and architected by:

### **Lukus Cane Evans #0047**  
GitHub: @lukusagent47  
Project Alias: MR Pool / LukusAI Architect

---

## 13. Roadmap
- Async memory module
- Auto-PR generation from AI drafts
- Full autonomous bot evaluation system
- Expand ThinkerBots to 7+ domains
